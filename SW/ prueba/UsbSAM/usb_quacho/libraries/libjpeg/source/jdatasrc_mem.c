 * While these routines are sufficient for most applications,
 * some will want to use a different source manager.
 * IMPORTANT: we assume that fread() will correctly transcribe an array of
 * JOCTETs from 8-bit-wide elements on external storage.  If char is wider
 * than 8 bits on your machine, you may need to do some tweaking.
